- Installed python 3.10.5 from python.org
- tried to run 'import numpy' didn't work
    => Installed anaconda
- pip installed numpy
- worked at terminal, still didn't work in text editor
- tried to change interpreter, didn't work
- pip installed coolprop
- coolprop still didn't work in text editor (module not found)
    => Found out why : maybe because the python version is newer than the one in wheel of coolprop
    => tried to find a way to install previous version of python, no clue
- Made some virtual environment === BEST DECISION ===
    => But the one that works and I still use is C:\Users\User\.venvironment\TATurbineDesign

- Copied given codes into a folder
- Made new folder 'My Codes'. Make thy version of .py and.ipynb in there

end
